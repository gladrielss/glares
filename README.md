# Reqly — social shopping requests (starter)

A Treffa-style app: people post "looking for X" requests, others reply with
recommendations, requester picks a favorite.

## Stack
- Frontend: plain HTML/CSS/vanilla JS (no build step, no framework)
- Backend: Supabase (Postgres + Auth + Storage), free tier
- Hosting: Cloudflare Pages — see CLOUDFLARE.md (Vercel config kept until the switch is confirmed)

## 1. Create a Supabase project
1. Go to https://supabase.com → New Project (free tier is fine)
2. Once created, go to Project Settings → API
3. Copy your **Project URL** and **anon public key**
4. Open `js/supabase-client.js` and paste them in

## 2. Create the database tables
Go to the Supabase dashboard → SQL Editor → paste and run this:

```sql
-- profiles: one row per user, auto-created on signup
create table profiles (
  id uuid references auth.users on delete cascade primary key,
  username text unique not null,
  created_at timestamptz default now()
);

-- requests: "looking for X" posts
create table requests (
  id uuid default gen_random_uuid() primary key,
  user_id uuid references profiles(id) on delete cascade not null,
  title text not null,
  description text,
  budget text,
  category text,
  image_url text,
  status text default 'open', -- 'open' | 'closed'
  created_at timestamptz default now()
);

-- recommendations: replies to a request
create table recommendations (
  id uuid default gen_random_uuid() primary key,
  request_id uuid references requests(id) on delete cascade not null,
  user_id uuid references profiles(id) on delete cascade not null,
  note text not null,
  link text,
  image_url text,
  is_favorite boolean default false,
  created_at timestamptz default now()
);

-- Row Level Security
alter table profiles enable row level security;
alter table requests enable row level security;
alter table recommendations enable row level security;

-- anyone can read; only owners can write their own rows
create policy "profiles are viewable by everyone" on profiles for select using (true);
create policy "users can insert their own profile" on profiles for insert with check (auth.uid() = id);

create policy "requests are viewable by everyone" on requests for select using (true);
create policy "users can insert their own requests" on requests for insert with check (auth.uid() = user_id);
create policy "users can update their own requests" on requests for update using (auth.uid() = user_id);

create policy "recommendations are viewable by everyone" on recommendations for select using (true);
create policy "users can insert their own recommendations" on recommendations for insert with check (auth.uid() = user_id);
create policy "requesters can mark favorite" on recommendations for update using (
  auth.uid() = (select user_id from requests where requests.id = request_id)
);

-- auto-create a profile row when someone signs up
create function public.handle_new_user()
returns trigger as $$
begin
  insert into public.profiles (id, username)
  values (new.id, split_part(new.email, '@', 1));
  return new;
end;
$$ language plpgsql security definer;

create trigger on_auth_user_created
  after insert on auth.users
  for each row execute procedure public.handle_new_user();
```

## 2b. Add song attachment + audience tag (run in SQL Editor, one-time)

```sql
alter table requests add column spotify_url text;
alter table requests add column audience text;
```

## 2c. Enable image upload from device (run in SQL Editor, one-time)

```sql
insert into storage.buckets (id, name, public)
values ('request-images', 'request-images', true)
on conflict (id) do nothing;

create policy "public can view request images"
on storage.objects for select
using (bucket_id = 'request-images');

create policy "signed in users can upload request images"
on storage.objects for insert
with check (bucket_id = 'request-images' and auth.role() = 'authenticated');
```

## 2d. Allow deleting your own posts (run in SQL Editor, one-time)

```sql
create policy "users can delete their own requests"
on requests for delete
using (auth.uid() = user_id);

create policy "users can delete their own recommendations"
on recommendations for delete
using (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

## 3. Enable email auth
Dashboard → Authentication → Providers → Email → make sure it's enabled.
This starter uses magic-link (passwordless) login — simplest for v1.

## 4. Run it locally
No build step needed. Just open `index.html` with a local server, e.g.:

```
npx serve .
```

(Opening the HTML file directly with `file://` will break Supabase auth redirects —
always serve it over http://localhost.)

## 5. Deploy
See CLOUDFLARE.md. The site itself is still plain static files; a one-line build step
copies them into `dist/` so server code isn't published alongside them.

## File map
- `index.html` — feed of open requests + "post a request" form
- `request.html` — one request's detail + recommendations + reply form
- `css/style.css` — all styling
- `js/supabase-client.js` — your project URL/key go here
- `js/auth.js` — magic-link login/logout, shared across pages
- `js/app.js` — feed page logic
- `js/request.js` — request detail page logic

## Monetization: affiliate links

`js/affiliate-config.js` rewrites recommendation links to include your
affiliate tracking ID before they're saved — earns you a commission on
purchases, invisible to users. Sign up for an affiliate program (Amazon
Associates, Awin, Rakuten Advertising are good starting points), then paste
your tag into that file. Any store you haven't configured is left alone —
nothing breaks.

## Monetization: promoted listings (QPay)

Businesses can pay to have their listing marked "Sponsored" and pinned to
the top of the feed. This uses QPay (Mongolia's payment platform) since
Stripe doesn't operate in Mongolia.

### 1. Get QPay merchant credentials
Sign up for a QPay merchant account at https://qpay.mn (or contact them —
this typically requires an agreement + a few business days for approval).
Once approved, you'll get:
- A Client ID and Client Secret (for API authentication)
- An Invoice Code (identifies your merchant account when creating invoices)

QPay also has a sandbox environment for testing before you're fully
approved — ask them for sandbox credentials if you want to test the flow
before going live.

### 2. Add the database column
Run in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
alter table requests add column is_sponsored boolean default false;
```

### 3. Set environment variables in Vercel
Go to your Vercel project → Settings → Environment Variables, and add:

- `QPAY_CLIENT_ID` — from QPay
- `QPAY_CLIENT_SECRET` — from QPay
- `QPAY_INVOICE_CODE` — from QPay
- `QPAY_BASE_URL` — `https://merchant-sandbox.qpay.mn/v2` for testing,
  `https://merchant.qpay.mn/v2` once live
- `SUPABASE_URL` — same as in `js/supabase-client.js`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` — Supabase → Project Settings → API →
  "service_role" key (NOT the anon/public one — this one is secret,
  never put it in any file that goes in the git repo)
- `SITE_URL` — your live site URL, e.g. `https://esven-seven.vercel.app`

After adding these, redeploy (Vercel → Deployments → ⋯ → Redeploy) so the
functions pick them up.

### 4. How it works
- Request owner taps "Promote this listing" on their request page
- A QPay QR code appears — they scan it with any Mongolian banking app
- Once paid, the listing is automatically marked sponsored and sorted to
  the top of the feed
- To change the price, edit `PROMOTION_PRICE_MNT` in `api/create-promotion.js`

## 2e. Add profile pictures (run in SQL Editor, one-time)

```sql
alter table profiles add column avatar_url text;
```

## Administrator moderation

Apply `supabase/migrations/20260907150700_admin_moderation.sql` in the **reqly** Supabase SQL Editor. It verifies that exactly one `@gladriel` profile exists, promotes it to administrator, and grants administrators permission to delete any request or recommendation.

The `Remove account` control uses `/api/admin-delete-user`. It requires `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` to be configured as Vercel environment variables. Never expose the service-role key in browser JavaScript.

## Password setup and Instagram browser

The login bar supports password sign-in and sends a password-recovery email through **Set or reset password**. The linked page shows a form to save the new password. In Supabase Authentication URL Configuration, add the deployed site URL as an allowed redirect URL. Instagram's in-app browser controls its own storage, so Glares shows visitors an **Open in browser** instruction; only the device browser can reliably retain the session across Instagram launches.

## What's next after this MVP
- Image upload (Supabase Storage) instead of pasted URLs
- Notifications when someone recommends on your request
- Search/filter by category
- Reputation score (count of favorited recommendations)
